# RESEARCH LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS

## 1. Survivorship Bias

**Issue:** Failed trading strategies are often not published.  
**Mitigation:** We cite studies of strategy decay and acknowledge that 90%+ of retail strategies fail.

## 2. Look-Ahead Bias

**Issue:** Using information not available at the time of the trade.  
**Mitigation:** All backtests use point-in-time data only; no future information.

## 3. Overfitting

**Issue:** Optimizing parameters to historical noise rather than signal.  
**Mitigation:** Simple strategies with few parameters; out-of-sample testing; walk-forward validation.

## 4. Changing Market Regimes

**Issue:** Markets evolve; past performance may not repeat.  
**Mitigation:** Multi-strategy approach; strategy rotation; continuous monitoring.

## 5. Limited Crypto History

**Issue:** Bitcoin only 15 years of data; limited crisis cycles.  
**Mitigation:** Extend with simulated data; validate against traditional markets; conservative assumptions.
